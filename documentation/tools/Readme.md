Drug Interaction Checker – Detailed Specifications
1. Purpose

The Drug Interaction Checker identifies potential interactions between medications. It helps prevent adverse effects, therapeutic failure, or toxicity by analyzing drug combinations.

2. Inputs
Field	Type	Description	Validation
Medication List	Array<String>	List of medications the patient is taking	Required
Dose & Frequency	Optional	Daily dose and administration frequency	Optional but recommended
Route of Administration	Optional	Oral, IV, IM, etc.	Optional
Patient Age	Number	Age in years	Optional
Patient Weight	Number	Weight in kg	Optional
Medical History	Checkbox list	Liver/kidney disease, heart disease, etc.	Optional
Allergies	Checkbox list	Known drug allergies	Optional
3. Processing / Formula

Base Logic:

Compare all medication pairs for known interactions using a drug database (e.g., DrugBank, OpenFDA).

Classify interactions by severity:

Minor: No clinical significance

Moderate: May require monitoring or dose adjustment

Major: Avoid combination; risk of serious adverse effect

AI Enhancement:

Analyze patient-specific factors (age, weight, comorbidities) for personalized interaction risk.

Predict interactions not yet documented in databases using ML models.

Suggest safer alternatives or dose adjustments.

4. Outputs
Output	Type	Description
Interaction Report	List<Object>	Each pair of drugs with interaction description
Severity Level	String	Minor / Moderate / Major
Recommendations	List<String>	Suggested actions, monitoring, or alternatives
Disclaimer	String	“Consult healthcare provider before making changes.”

Example:

Input: Warfarin + Amoxicillin →

Output: Interaction: Increased bleeding risk, Severity: Major, Recommendation: Monitor INR closely, consider alternative antibiotic

5. AI Integration

AI is required for this tool:

Improves detection of rare or undocumented interactions.

Incorporates patient-specific data (age, weight, labs).

Provides alternative drug suggestions or dosing adjustments.

Generates natural-language explanations of interaction mechanisms.

Example AI Output:

“The combination of warfarin and amoxicillin increases bleeding risk due to antibiotic-induced reduction of gut flora affecting vitamin K. Monitor INR, and consider alternative antibiotic if possible.”

6. Recommendations

Avoid high-risk drug combinations when possible.

Monitor labs (INR, kidney/liver function) as advised.

Adjust doses or timing if necessary.

Educate patients about possible adverse effects.

7. User Guidance

Allow users to input multiple drugs at once.

Highlight high-severity interactions first.

Include links to credible references for each interaction.

Provide a “what-if” scenario tool to test alternative medications.

8. Disclaimers & Safety

“This tool provides interaction guidance; always consult a healthcare professional before making changes.”

“Patient-specific factors may influence risk; use in conjunction with clinical judgment.”

9. Tracking / History

Store previous interaction checks for patient records.

Track flagged interactions for follow-up.

Allow export of interaction reports for physicians or pharmacists.
